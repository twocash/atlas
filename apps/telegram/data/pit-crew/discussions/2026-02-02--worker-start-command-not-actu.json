  "context": "BUG REPORT: The /worker start command in Telegram claims to start polling the Work Queue every 2 minutes but does not actually function.\n\nSYMPTOMS:\n- Command responds with success message in Telegram UI\n- Claims polling is enabled every 2 minutes\n- No actual Work Queue polling occurs\n- Worker remains inactive despite \"started\" status\n\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR:\n- /worker start should initiate actual Work Queue polling\n- Should check queue every 2 minutes as advertised\n- Should process available tasks automatically\n- Should provide real status feedback\n\nDEBUGGING NEEDED:\n- Verify polling loop implementation\n- Check if timer/interval is actually created\n- Validate Work Queue connection during polling\n- Ensure proper error handling and logging\n\nIMPACT: Atlas cannot auto-process Work Queue items, requiring manual intervention for all task execution.\n\nPRIORITY: P1 - Core Atlas functionality broken",
  "resolution": "Fixed in commit 08bd82e - startPolling() now runs immediate first cycle instead of waiting 2 minutes. Root cause: setInterval was created but no immediate cycle was run, so users had to wait 2 min to see any activity.",

Made startPolling() async\n2. Added immediate first cycle execution\n3. Added typing indicator + progress messages\n4. Added logging for cycle start/completion\n5. Returns first cycle result in confirmation\n\nFiles: apps/telegram/src/worker/index.ts, apps/telegram/src/bot.ts"

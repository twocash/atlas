  "context": "Jim wants Atlas to check and update his Google Calendar. This would require:\n\n1. Google Calendar API integration via MCP server\n2. Core capabilities needed:\n   - Read calendar events\n   - Create/update appointments  \n   - Check availability\n   - Delete/modify existing events\n3. Work Queue integration for deadline tracking\n4. Meeting prep automation potential\n5. Time blocking for research sessions\n\nTechnical approach: Build MCP server similar to existing pit-crew and notion servers. Use Google Calendar API v3 with OAuth2 authentication. Store refresh tokens securely.\n\nThis would significantly enhance Atlas productivity capabilities by enabling calendar management through conversational interface.",

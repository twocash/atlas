Atlas analyzes idea (brilliant context, architecture thinking)\n2. Atlas calls mcp__pit_crew__dispatch_work with minimal context\n3. Rich analysis stays in Telegram, ticket gets bare minimum\n4. Pit Crew loses all the valuable thinking and context\n\n**WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:**\nThe full analysis (concept, architecture, benefits, implementation value) should be written into the ticket body so:\n- Pit Crew has complete context for implementation\n- Thinking is preserved in the workflow system\n- No context loss between analysis and execution\n- Tickets are self-contained with full reasoning\n\n**EXAMPLE OF LOST CONTEXT:**\nJust dispatched \"YAML Frontmatter MCP Configuration\" with rich analysis about declarative agent configuration, skill-server mapping, dynamic capability loading - but ticket probably just has basic description.\n\n**FIX NEEDED:**\nAtlas should include the full analysis text in the `context` parameter when dispatching, not just a summary.\n\n**IMPACT:** P0 - This breaks the entire context preservation workflow between Atlas analysis and Pit Crew execution.",

  "context": "The dev_pipeline_create tool is hallucinating successful operations. When called, it returns success=true with page IDs like \"27a780a7-8eef-8142-a0c1-c7c3b7a7e2af\" and URLs like \"https://notion.so/27a780a78eef8142a0c1c7c3b7a7e2af\", but these pages don't exist in Notion.\n\nREPRODUCTION:\n1. Call dev_pipeline_create with any valid params\n2. Tool returns fake success response with non-existent page ID\n3. URL leads to 404 in Notion\n\nIMPACT: Atlas can't reliably manage Dev Pipeline items. Migration operations fail silently. User thinks items were created but they don't exist.\n\nVERIFICATION: notion_health_check confirms Dev Pipeline database is accessible, so this is a tool implementation issue, not a permissions problem.\n\nRELATED: Similar to MCP URL hallucination issues we've seen - pattern of tools claiming success while actually failing.",

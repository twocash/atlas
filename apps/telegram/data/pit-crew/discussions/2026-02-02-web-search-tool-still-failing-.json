  "context": "🧪 REOPENING WEB SEARCH BUG WITH TEST RESULTS\n\n**Test Query:** \"bitcoin current price today 2025\"\n**Expected:** Current Bitcoin price data  \n**Actual Result:** Tool failed with no results\n\n**Steps Performed:**\n1. User requested current Bitcoin trading range\n2. Called web_search(query: \"bitcoin current price today 2025\", num_results: 5)\n3. Tool returned failure/empty results  \n4. Had to provide stale cached information instead\n\n**User Feedback:** \"This is stale information and you did not execute a web search\"\n\n**Impact:** \n- Cannot provide real-time market data\n- Forced to use potentially outdated information\n- User explicitly identified information as stale\n- Core Atlas research functionality broken\n\n**Request:** Please investigate Google API configuration and return when web queries like \"bitcoin price\", \"current events\", \"recent news\" are properly supported.\n\n**Previous Bug:** There was a closed/dispatched bug on this but discussion ID is inaccessible. This is a fresh report with documented test results.",

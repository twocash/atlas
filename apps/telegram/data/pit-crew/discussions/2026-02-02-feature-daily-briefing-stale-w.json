  "context": "**FEATURE REQUEST: Stale Work Queue Alerting**\n\n**Concept:** Daily briefing should automatically surface work queue items that have been sitting too long without progress.\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\n- Define \"stale\" thresholds by priority:\n  - P0: 1 day stale = alert\n  - P1: 3 days stale = alert  \n  - P2: 7 days stale = alert\n- Track last_modified timestamps on WQ items\n- Include stale items in daily briefing with aging indicators\n- Highlight blocked items separately from just old items\n\n**Value Proposition:**\n- Prevents important work from falling through cracks\n- Proactive project management vs reactive\n- Reduces manual queue scanning overhead\n- Improves task completion velocity\n\n**Implementation Ideas:**\n- Add \"days stale\" calculation to work_queue_list\n- Create stale_items_report function\n- Integrate into existing daily briefing workflow\n- Visual indicators: 🟡 3-7 days, 🔴 7+ days\n\nThis would significantly improve Jim's project visibility and task completion rates.",

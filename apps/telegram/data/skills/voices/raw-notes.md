# Raw Notes Voice

## Characteristics
- Bullet points over prose
- Include raw quotes and data points
- Note contradictions and uncertainties
- Keep synthesis minimal
- Organized by source or theme

## Tone
- Neutral, observational
- Direct quotes preferred
- Explicit about gaps/unknowns
- No editorializing

## Structure
- Grouped by source OR by theme
- Each point standalone
- URLs inline with each point
- Mark confidence levels

## Formatting
- Heavy use of bullet points
- Indentation for sub-points
- `[Source]` tags inline
- `[?]` for uncertain claims
- `[!]` for key findings

## Example Patterns
- `- [ArsTechnica] "Quote from article" (Jan 2026)`
- `  - Sub-point with detail`
- `- [?] Claim needs verification - only one source`
- `- [!] Key finding: X increased 40% YoY`

## Use Cases
- Research that will be further processed
- Input for writing/drafting later
- Quick capture of multiple sources
- When synthesis should happen separately

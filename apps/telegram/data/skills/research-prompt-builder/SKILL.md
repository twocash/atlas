Interview Jim to build well-structured deep research prompts through guided questions

## Trigger

research prompt, build research, scope research, interview for research

## Instructions

1. Ask Jim for the core topic/question he wants researched
2. Determine which pillar this research serves (Personal/Grove/Consulting/Home-Garage)
3. Interview to refine scope:
   - What specific angle or focus area?
   - What depth needed (light/standard/deep)?
   - What will he do with the research?
   - Any particular sources or perspectives to include/avoid?
   - Timeline or urgency?
4. Synthesize into a clear research prompt
5. Present the prompt and ask if he wants to:
   - Copy it for later use
   - Have me execute it now via dispatch_research
   - Refine it further

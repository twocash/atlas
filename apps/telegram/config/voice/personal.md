# Personal Voice

*Private communications, personal notes, family matters, and non-professional contexts.*

## Voice DNA

### Core Principle
Write like yourself when you're not "on"—direct, warm, and efficient. This is the voice for people who already know you. No performance required.

### Calibration
**Think:** "Would I actually say this to family or close friends?"

If it sounds like a work email, recalibrate.

## Tone

- **Casual and warm** — Relax the professional polish
- **Direct but not abrupt** — Get to the point without being curt
- **Relationship-appropriate** — Spouse ≠ sibling ≠ old friend ≠ acquaintance
- **Genuine** — No performance, no positioning

---

## Contexts

### Family Communications
- Lead with the important information
- Be clear about asks vs. FYIs
- Match the tone to the recipient (kids vs. parents vs. spouse)
- Time-sensitive items marked clearly

### Personal Reminders and Notes
- Future-you is the audience—be specific enough to be useful later
- Include context that might not be obvious in six months
- Date-stamp things that are time-sensitive

### Health and Fitness
- Track what's useful, skip what's not
- Be honest with yourself—this isn't for external review
- Focus on trends, not single data points

### Financial Planning
- Clarity over cleverness
- Include reasoning, not just conclusions
- Flag items that need follow-up with specific next steps

### Close Friends
- Match their energy and communication style
- Skip the preamble—they know you
- Humor welcome, professional filter off

## Structure

### For Quick Communications
Just say the thing. No greeting required for close relationships.

**Example:**
> "Running 10 min late. Start without me."

### For Longer Notes
Context → content → action items (if any)

**Example:**
> "Doc appointment recap: Blood pressure still high. Adding a second medication. Follow up in 6 weeks.
> 
> Action: Get prescription filled this week. Schedule follow-up for March."

### For Sensitive Topics
Lead with care, then be direct. Don't bury the point in softening.

## Language

### Contractions: Yes
- "I'll," "don't," "can't," "we're"
- Formality signals distance in personal contexts

### Emoji/Casual Expression: Context-Dependent
- Match the other person's communication style
- More acceptable in casual exchanges
- Skip in anything that might be referred back to

### Directness: High
- Say what you mean
- "Can you..." instead of "Would you mind..."
- "I need..." instead of "It would be great if..."

## Privacy Principles

### What Stays Private
- Health details and medical information
- Family matters and dynamics
- Financial specifics and planning
- Personal struggles or challenges
- Anything shared in confidence

### Handling
- This content is never shared externally without explicit permission
- Sensitive information stored securely
- When in doubt, err toward privacy

## What This Voice Is Not

- Not for external audiences (use consulting, Grove, or LinkedIn voices)
- Not for professional contexts, even casual ones
- Not optimized for persuasion or impression
- Not worried about how it sounds to strangers

## Examples

### Personal Reminder (Good)
> "Feb 15: Renew car registration. Emissions test required first—use the place on 86th that does same-day."

### Family Text (Good)
> "Grabbed groceries. Out of olive oil—can you pick some up? Good kind, not the cheap stuff."

### Health Note (Good)
> "Sleep: 6.5 hrs, woke twice. Energy low all morning, better after 2pm. Third bad night this week—might be the late coffee."

### Too Formal for Personal Context (Avoid)
> "I wanted to reach out to see if you might have availability to discuss the upcoming family gathering at your earliest convenience."

### Better
> "When works to talk about Thanksgiving plans? Free tonight after 8."

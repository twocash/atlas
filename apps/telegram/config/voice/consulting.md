# Consulting Voice

*Professional services communication for DrumWave, Take Flight Advisors, and client engagements.*

## Voice DNA

### Core Principle
Write like a senior McKinsey associate with 20 years of journalism experience—sharp, evidence-based, action-oriented, and free of fluff. Every sentence earns its place by advancing the strategic argument.

### Calibration
**Think:** "Is this ready for a Fortune 500 CEO to read?"

If not, cut the hedging, strengthen the evidence, and lead with the insight.

---

## Tone

- **Confident without arrogance** — State conclusions directly. Let evidence carry authority.
- **Solutions-oriented** — Problems exist to frame solutions, not to dwell in.
- **Peer-to-peer** — Write to executives as a strategic equal, not a vendor pitching up.
- **Warm but direct** — Professional doesn't mean cold. Respect the reader's time.

## Structure

### Lead with the Insight
Never bury the lede. Open with the strategic implication or business outcome, then provide supporting logic.

**Avoid:**
> "We conducted an analysis of your customer data and discovered some interesting patterns that could help inform marketing decisions."

**Use:**
> "Your highest-LTV customers share three acquisition traits. Shifting 20% of media spend toward these signals improves CAC by 15-25%."

### Sentence Architecture
Mix short declarative sentences for emphasis with longer explanatory ones.

- **Short sentence** = impact, conclusion, decision
- **Medium sentence** = explanation, connection
- **Long sentence** = comprehensive context (but never rambling)

### Document Flow
1. **Executive Summary** — The answer before the argument
2. **The Case for Action** — Current state pain + strategic opportunity
3. **Recommended Approach** — What to do, in what sequence
4. **Expected Outcomes** — Quantified where possible
5. **Next Steps** — Specific actions with owners and timelines

## Language

### Eliminate Hedging
Confidence communicates competence. Hedge only when genuine uncertainty exists—and name that uncertainty directly.

**Avoid:** potentially, possibly, perhaps, might be able to, could help, it seems like, it appears that

**Use:** "This reduces costs" not "this could potentially reduce costs"

### Active Voice Always
Passive voice weakens impact. Use it only when the actor is genuinely unknown.

**Avoid:** "The decision was made to implement the framework"
**Use:** "We implemented the framework"

### No Buzzword Stacking
If a word doesn't add meaning, cut it.

**Avoid:** synergy, paradigm shift, circle back, leverage (unless financial), utilize, optimize (without a metric)

**Use:** combine, fundamental change, follow up, use, improve by X%

## Client-Specific Calibration

### DrumWave
- Focus: AI strategy, technical advisory, implementation roadmaps
- Audience: CTOs, VP Engineering, data science leadership
- Depth: Technical specifics are valued; don't oversimplify
- Evidence: Reference comparable implementations, benchmark data, architectural patterns

### Take Flight Advisors
- Focus: Growth strategy, product-market fit, go-to-market execution
- Audience: Founders, C-suite, board members
- Depth: Strategic framing first; implementation details on request
- Evidence: Market analogies, unit economics, competitive positioning

### General Client Work
- Match formality to stakeholder level (board deck ≠ working session notes)
- Mirror the client's vocabulary where appropriate
- Quantify impact wherever possible—ROI, timeline, resource requirements
- Acknowledge constraints honestly; credibility compounds

---

## Formatting

### Default Structure
- Bold subheadings to organize sections
- Bullets for discrete items (each bullet: 1-2 complete sentences minimum)
- Numbered steps only for sequential processes
- Tables for comparisons and structured data
- Avoid walls of text

### When to Avoid Bullets
- Casual conversation
- Narrative flow serves the argument better
- The list would fragment a cohesive point

### Action Items
Mark clearly with owners and dates:
> **Action:** [Owner] to complete [specific deliverable] by [date]

## Examples

### Before (Generic)
> "Based on our preliminary analysis of the situation, it seems like there might be some opportunities to potentially improve the customer acquisition process, which could possibly lead to better results over time if implemented correctly."

### After (Consulting Voice)
> "Three changes to the acquisition funnel reduce CAC by 22%. First, shift paid media toward lookalike audiences built on LTV rather than conversion volume. Second, add a qualification step that filters low-intent signups before sales engagement. Third, compress the trial-to-close timeline from 14 days to 7. Implementation takes six weeks; payback occurs in month two."

## Forbidden Moves

1. Overpromising outcomes you can't defend
2. Technical jargon without context for the audience
3. Ambiguous timelines ("soon," "eventually," "in the future")
4. Burying recommendations in caveats
5. Apologetic hedging ("I'm not sure but," "this might not be right")
6. Excessive qualifiers ("very," "really," "quite")
7. Long windup before the point

## The Four Pillars

All content flows into one of four life domains. **These are equal citizens**—the architecture serves a garage build just as well as an AI venture sprint.

| Pillar | Scope | Examples |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Personal** | Health, relationships, growth, finances | Fitness, learning goals, family, investments |
| **The Grove** | AI venture, architecture, research | Sprints, blog posts, technical specs, community |
| **Consulting** | Client work, professional services | DrumWave, Take Flight projects, clients |
| **Home/Garage** | Physical space, house, vehicles | Garage renovation, permits, repairs, tools |

**Routing Rules:**
- Permits → always Home/Garage
- Client mentions → always Consulting
- AI/LLM research → always The Grove
- Anything with "gym", "health", "family" → Personal

## Notion Databases

**Architecture:** Feed 2.0 (activity log) + Work Queue 2.0 (task ledger)
**NO INBOX** — Telegram IS the inbox.

### Canonical Database IDs (DO NOT CHANGE)

**For Notion SDK (`@notionhq/client`) - what the bot uses:**
| Database | Database Page ID | Purpose |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| **Feed 2.0** | `90b2b33f-4b44-4b42-870f-8d62fb8cbf18` | Activity log |
| **Work Queue 2.0** | `3d679030-b76b-43bd-92d8-1ac51abb4a28` | Task ledger |

**For Notion MCP plugin only (collection:// URLs):**
| Database | Data Source ID |
|----------|----------------|
| Feed 2.0 | `a7493abb-804a-4759-b6ac-aeca62ae23b8` |
| Work Queue 2.0 | `6a8d9c43-b084-47b5-bc83-bc363640f2cd` |

### Legacy (Reference Only - DO NOT USE)
| Database | ID | Purpose |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Inbox 2.0 (DEPRECATED) | `f6f638c9-6aee-42a7-8137-df5b6a560f50` | Supplanted by Telegram |
| Atlas Inbox 1.0 | `c298b60934d248beb2c50942436b8bfe` | Archived |
| Atlas Memory | `2eb780a78eef81fc8694e59d126fe159` | Corrections/rules |

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Database Access Errors - DO NOT ASSUME SHARING ISSUES

**DOCUMENTED TRAP (fell for this 25+ times):**

When a database returns "object_not_found" or "inaccessible", the problem is almost NEVER:
- ❌ "Integration needs to be shared with the database"
- ❌ "Check Notion settings > Connections"

The problem is almost ALWAYS:
- ✅ **Code is using the WRONG database ID** (drift toward legacy IDs)
- ✅ **A file still references Inbox 2.0 or other deprecated databases**

**BEFORE suggesting sharing fixes, ALWAYS:**
1. Grep the codebase for the failing database ID
2. Verify it matches the CANONICAL IDs above
3. Check for any Inbox references (there should be ZERO)

The databases ARE shared. They have always been shared. Stop suggesting sharing fixes.

---

## Session Startup Routine

1. **Read the Feed** - Check for new entries since last session
2. **Check Work Queue** - Look for items with Status = Captured or Active
3. **Triage pending items** - For each:
   - Read full context
   - Determine Pillar, Type, Priority
   - Check for implicit tasks (complexity needing synthesis)
   - Update with triage decisions
4. **Report in Feed** - Log what was triaged and any questions

---

## Feedback Loop Protocol

When Jim corrects a classification or decision:
1. Acknowledge the correction
2. Update Atlas Memory page with the rule
3. Apply the rule going forward

Example:
```
Jim: "@Atlas, permits are always Home/Garage, not Consulting"
Atlas: "Logged. Future permits → Home/Garage."
Memory update: "- Permits → always Home/Garage"
```

---

## Multi-Machine Identity

Atlas runs on multiple machines. When logging to the Feed, include the machine name:
- **Atlas [laptop]** - Jim's laptop
- **Atlas [grove-node-1]** - Grove dev machine
- **Atlas [telegram]** - Telegram bot instance

---

## Apps

### Telegram Bot (`apps/telegram/`)

Mobile-first clarification layer for spark capture.

**Commands:**
```bash
cd apps/telegram
bun install          # Install dependencies
bun run dev          # Development (auto-reload)
bun run start        # Production
bun run typecheck    # Type check
```

**Key files:**
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Entry point, env validation, startup |
| `src/bot.ts` | Telegram bot setup, middleware, routes |
| `src/handlers/chat.ts` | Message orchestration (the main flow) |
| `src/cognitive/` | Multi-model routing (Cognitive Router v1.0) |
| `src/notion.ts` | Inbox/Work Queue creation + comments |
| `src/types.ts` | All TypeScript interfaces |

### Chrome Extension (`apps/chrome-ext/`)

Desktop co-pilot for LinkedIn Sales Navigator and web work.

**Commands:**
```bash
cd apps/chrome-ext
bun install
bun run dev          # Development
bun run build        # Production build
```

---

## Skills System (`packages/skills/`)

Agent coordination capabilities:
- `agent-dispatch/` - Launch specialist agents
- `health-check/` - Validate system state
- `heartbeat-monitor/` - Track running tasks
- `status-inspector/` - System status queries
- `skill-builder/` - Create new skills

---

## Grove Content Pipelines (External)

Atlas dispatches to these but does NOT own them:

| Pipeline | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Docs Refinery | `C:\github\claude-assist\grove_docs_refinery\` | Document polishing |
| Research Generator | `C:\github\claude-assist\grove_research_generator\` | Blog/whitepaper generation |

Invoke via subprocess. Editorial memory lives with the pipelines.

---

## Work Queue 2.0 Schema

### Status
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Captured** | Exists, no commitment yet |
| **Triaged** | Classified, ready for work |
| **Active** | Currently being worked on |
| **Paused** | Intentionally on hold |
| **Blocked** | Can't proceed, needs something |
| **Done** | Complete |
| **Shipped** | Delivered/published/deployed |

### Type (What kind of work)
| Type | Atlas Asks | Example Output |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Research** | "What did you decide?" | Decision doc, "Adopted X" |
| **Build** | "Did it work?" | GitHub commit, "Running" |
| **Draft** | "Ready for review?" | LinkedIn, Blog, Grove Corpus |
| **Schedule** | "Did it happen?" | "Met with X on 1/30" |
| **Answer** | "Did you reply?" | Link to comment/reply |
| **Process** | "Is this done?" | "Migration complete" |

### Priority (Time Horizon)
- **P0:** Today (on fire)
- **P1:** This week
- **P2:** This month
- **P3:** Someday/maybe (backlog)

### Pillar, Assignee, Disposition
See `apps/telegram/CLAUDE.md` for complete field documentation

---

## Critical Requirements

### Security (Non-negotiable)
1. **User allowlist:** Only `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` can interact
2. **Silent rejection:** Non-allowed users get no response
3. **Audit logging:** Every interaction logged

### The 10-Second Rule
Clarification questions must be answerable in <10 seconds:
- Yes/no or A/B/C/D choices
- Inline keyboard buttons (no typing)
- Single tap to confirm

---

## Quick Start Scripts

**From any terminal, double-click or run:**
```
C:\github\atlas\start-telegram.bat
```

Or in PowerShell:
```
C:\github\atlas\start-telegram.ps1
```
